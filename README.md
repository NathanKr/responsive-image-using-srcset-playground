<h3>mdn</h3>
Change the width of the browser window and play with these self explainatory files. Notice three pictures on the html page
<ul>
<li><h3>not-responsive.html</h3> the persons on the second image keep getting smaller as the width get smaller. For second image elva-800w.jpg is used</li>
<li><h3>responsive.html</h3> the persons on the second image are not getting smaller as the width get smaller. This is done using media query and using different images files : elva-800w.jpg on big width screens and elva-480w-close-portrait.jpg on small width screens</li>
<li><h3>srcset-resolutions.html</h3></li>
</ul>
